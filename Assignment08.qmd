##### From the three methods (best subset, forward stepwise, and backward stepwise):
- a.Which of the three models with k predictors has the smallest training RSS? 
  - Best subset method is the one out of three models with k predictors has the smallest training RSS because it is selected from among all k predictors models.

- b.Which of the three models with k predictors has the smallest test RSS? 
  - Best subset method is the one out of the three models with K predictors has the smallest test RSS because it takes into account more models than the other methods. 

##### Generate simulated data, and then use this data to perform best subset selection.

###### 1.Use the rnorm() function to generate a predictor X of length n = 100, as well as a noise vector 𝜀of length n = 100. 
```{r}
set.seed(1)
X= rnorm(100)
eps = rnorm(100)
```

###### 2.Generate a response vector 𝑦of length n = 100 according to the model:𝑦=β0+β1𝑥+β2𝑥2+β3𝑥3+ε, 𝑦=β0+β1𝑥+β2𝑥2+β3𝑥3+ε where β0,β1,β2𝑎𝑛𝑑β3  are 4, 9, 2, 1 respectively.
```{r}
Y <- 4 + 9*X + 2*X^2 + 1*X^3 + eps
```

##### 2a. Plot X and Y
```{r}
plot(X, Y)
```

##### 3.Use the leaps package
```{r}
require(leaps)
library(leaps)
```

##### 4.Use the regsubsets() function from the leaps packageto perform best subset selection in order to choose the best model containing the predictors. X, X^2 ... X^10. Hint: regsubsets(Y~poly(X,10,raw=T), data=data.frame(Y,X), nvmax=10)
```{r}
df <- data.frame(y=Y, x=X)
fit <- regsubsets(Y ~ poly(X, 10, raw=T), data =data.frame(Y,X), nvmax = 10)
fit.summary <- summary(fit)
names(fit)
```

##### 4a. What is the best model obtained according to Cp, BIC, and adjusted 𝑅2? 
```{r}
which.min(fit.summary$cp)
which.min(fit.summary$bic)
which.min(fit.summary$adjr2)
```

##### 4b. Show some plots to provide evidence for your answer, and report the coefficients of the best model obtained. Note you will need to use the data.frame() function to create a single data set containing both 𝑥and 𝑦.
```{r}
plot(fit.summary$cp, xlab="Subset Size", ylab="Cp", pch=30, type="l")
points(3, fit.summary$cp[3], pch=4, col="red", lwd=7)
plot(fit.summary$bic, xlab="Subset Size", ylab="BIC", pch=30, type="l")
points(3, fit.summary$bic[3], pch=4, col="red", lwd=7)
plot(fit.summary$adjr2, xlab="Subset Size", ylab="Adjusted R2", pch=30, type="l")
points(3, fit.summary$adjr2[3], pch=4, col="red", lwd=7)
# Finding: With Cp, BIC and Adjusted R2 criteria, 3, 3, and 3 variable models are picked respectively.
```
##### 4c. Find coefficients
```{r}
coefficients(fit, id=4)
```
